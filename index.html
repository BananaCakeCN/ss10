                	<h1>Crimes against humanity after war</h1>
                    <p>Japanese military made war crime actions at everywhere they occupied, including Beijing.</p>
                    <p>This news article published on the 26th year of the Republic of China, August 30th narrated what was going on after the Japanese army occupied Beijing.</p>
                    <p style="border: 3px solid red;">In the four suburbs of Beijing, wherever the enemies went, they raped, robbed, and killed randomly. Almost no residents survived.</p>
                    <p style="border: 3px solid blue;">Wherever the enemies went, they forced the locals to conscript women for them to rape, including the old ladies that aged sixty, and children that were below ten years old.</p>
                    <p style="border: 3px solid green;">At the West of Beijing, Southwest of Mentougou, there is a famous temple named Tanzhe Temple. There were more than a hundred women evacuate here from the West suburb. What wasn’t expecting is, this was known by the enemies. They blocked them all and distributed one woman to every three soldiers. Most of the hundreds of women were murdered and raped, and the rest of them were raped and murdered.</p>
                    <p>Comparing to the other occupied territories, the war crimes of the Japanese at Beijing wasn’t even severe. </p>

                    <p>Originally, the amount of Japanese soldiers around Hebei was 5000. After the army supplies, this number gained to 40000. They also had better weapons than the Chinese army.</p>
                    <p>At 8 a.m. of July 28th, the battle officially started. Chinese army at Nanyuan were being surrounded and defeated, Qinghe was occupied within the same day.</p>
                    <p>On July 29th, The Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Tianjin. It was successful. But more Japanese soldiers came after, the Chinese army then evacuated to the south. Tianjin was occupied on August 1st.</p>
                    <p>On July 30th, Japan occupied Beijing.</p>
                    <p>Japan occupied the area between Beijing and Tianjin, which marks their success of the battle. The battle resulted in almost 10000 casualties for the Chinese soldiers. Japan claimed that they had 1233 casualties. But some statements said that this number is not reliable, and the actual number of it is around 3000.</p>
                    <p>After this battle, the warlord Song, Zheyuan requested to get a formal punishment from Chiang Kai-shek. </p>

                	<h1>Resolving the July 7 incident</h1>
                    <p>The bombing to Wanping continued. At the same time, the two forces were negotiating. Japan required the Chinese army to evacuate from Yongding River. The request was refused.</p>
                    <p>On July 9th, Chiang Kai-shek sent army to the north for supporting the battle around Beijing, and told Song, Zheyuan, the warlord of Hebei, to command his armies. However, he said, Japan at this time is unlikely to start a full-scale war with China. If we take one step back, there is a chance to resolve the conflict.</p>
                    <p>Japan had an internal conversation of whether to start a full-scale war with China or not. The result of conversation was to send militaries from Japan mainland, Korea, and Manchuria to Hebei. It was a great idea to start a full-scale war with the excuses of the Lugou bridge incident. The missing soldier was not the direct cause of the war. If that soldier was not missing, they will start the war with another excuse. At this time, Japan was not just recovering their economic by taking lands. They already had Manchuria, which has the best land for farming, and its area is 4 times bigger than Japan itself. They wanted to start the war to build a new order for the East Asia that is led by Japan for their fascism, militarism and imperialism ideas.</p>
                    <p>The warlord of Hebei signed an agreement with the Japanese. In this agreement, the Chinese army will be apologizing to the Japanese army, punishing the responsible, evacuating from Lugou Bridge, and replacing the soldiers with guards. They made this agreement even if the Chinese army found that there is no such person missing in the city, and all the guns had the exact number of bullets as it supposed to.</p>
                    <p>The Song, Zheyuan warlord thought that he successfully resolved this incident. He prevented the army supplies from Chiang Kai-shek, because he thought that it was unnecessary, and those armies were threatening his rules in Hebei. If those armies settled in Hebei, they could easily take over the 29th army under the warlord. But what he didn’t know is, Japan was sending more armies to China, and this agreement was just for making the Chinese armies not ready for the upcoming battle. Basically, the Japanese lied, and that was their strategies.</p>
                    <p>On July 17th, Chiang Kai-shek announced the Lushan Declaration in Lushan.</p>
                    <p>Leaders of Nanjing informed Song, Zheyuan the consequences for multiple times. They even informed him that the Japanese armies are surrounding his army. However, he still ignored the messages from Chiang Kai-shek and even made a secret agreement to evacuate from Beijing and abandon the fortifications. The turning point was on July 23rd, Chiang Kai-shek had a military intelligence for the news of more Japanese armies were surrounding Hebei. When Song, Zheyuan heard of this news, he immediately commanded his army to stop evacuating and strengthen the fortifications. But it was too late.</p>
                    <p>In the morning of July 26th, the army forces of Japan bombed the military estate at Langfang. And occupied Langfang City at noon.</p>
                    <p>Song, Zheyuan was founded as a hero of anti-Japanese before this incident. He did not want Beijing and Tianjin to be taken by the Japanese army for his foolishness. On this day, he sent three telegrams to Nanjing for military support. </p>

                	<h1>July 7 Incident</h1>
                	<h3>How did the Pacific side of World War II began?</h3>
                	<p>On July 7th, 1937, a Japanese Unit at Fengtai began its training. It took place at the north of the Wanping City, a place beside to Beijing, currently inside the urban area and boundary of Beijing. Before the incident, this is a part of the Chinese territory, not even inside the Japanese occupied zone.</p>
                	<p>At 10:40 p.m. of July 7th. The Japanese army ended their training due to the sound of gun shots were heard. They went on attendance and quickly found that a private rank (lowest rank) soldier named Shimura Kikujiro (志村菊次郎) was missing. What was actually happening was, this private rank soldier went to poop during the training. When he came back, he found that the other soldiers were gone, so he returned. But on the way back, he got lost, which delayed the time of returned. At 11 p.m., a few Japanese came to the Wanping City and asking permissions from the Chinese army to search for that missing soldier. They refused the request. At 4:20 of the next day, the Japanese army bombed the Wanping City.</p>
                	<p>The missing soldier returned. But the Japanese commander did not report this to the upper level, and the incident was still going on. The sound of gun shot was by the Japanese soldiers. This was proven after the war by a Japanese commander.</p>
                	<p>Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanjing Nationalist Government knew the importance of this incident. If the Japanese Army controls the Wanping City, Chinese will lose access to the Beijing City as they are surrounding it. The Japanese at the same time will also gain the access of railway to the south.</p>

                    <p>During the 1930s, Japanese armies and other western military forces were settled around Beijing. China was under the civil war. The warlords were fighting against Nanjing Nationalist and other warlords. Most of the people weren’t educated, which made the ideas of Nationalism harder to spread. People were extremely poor, 3-7 million of people per year were dying due to the starving. </p>

                <p>The statement of “World War II started on September 1st, 1939” might not be a fact, but an opinion.</p>
                <p>Some historians date the beginning of the World War II to the July 7 Incident on July 7th, 1937. This event marks the start of war on the Pacific.</p>
                <p>A few historians, such as Antony Beevor, date the beginning of the World War II to the Manchuria Incident on September 18th, 1931. Which is 8 years earlier than the date of Germany invaded Poland.</p>
